        <h3>Addendum</h3>
        <p>
          My goal in this lab was to get my resume looking more like a resume.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew right off the bat I wanted it to have two sides, so I did some
          research
        </p>
        <p>
          where I came accross coding for columns. I chose two different colors
          for right and left to create seperation.I was able to get my
          information into columns, but that was pretty much as far as I could
          get because I struggled to get the sizing of the box model elements to
          appear how I envisioned. I used the Kalam font cause I just thought it
          looked clean. I used the h2 tag for everything relating to a div class
          name the section titles would be uniform, I also labeled all the
          important things with the h3 tag. I left all the text heavy areas
          alone. Using few tags allowed me to easily style the page because I
          used limited tags.
