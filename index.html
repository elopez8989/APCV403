      There is a universal set of "web safe fonts". When a browser utilizes one
      of these "safe" fonts, there is no external request made to retrieve the
      font becuase it is already embedded within the browser. These "web safe"
      fonts can be displayed by all browsers.
    </p>

      You can either host your own fonts locally by downloading the font-face
      kit onto your machine or you can use a font service that hosts the fonts
      and then you would apply the html code into your css file.
    </p>

      Like any internet process, displaying a font requires a request and a
      response from the server housing the font. When you use special fonts on
      your page, the browser will send a request to the server that is hosting
      the font in an attempt to find and display the font correctly. When a user
      accesses your site, the css font file you have assigned to your page is
      downloaded with the page files itself and display accordingly. A browser
      will always use the first file it can access, even if it is not the
      primary font you have set.
