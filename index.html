      <p>
        This project was a challenge. I decided to use a table becuase it was
        the closet thing to a "game board". I oringinally tried with css grid to
        make the board, but was able to get the js to correspond to what I was
        trying to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        I liked picking colors and fonts for my project. I also was adimit on
        finding how to make the font blink. I did a lot of reading to interpret
        how to make the game function. However, I wasnt able to connect an alert
        with winning the game. I just coulndt put together the right syntax to
        make this happen.
